# Uniform-Error-Bounds-for-Stochastic-Kriging

This repository contains the MATLAB code for the numerical experiments in the paper "Uniform Error Bounds for Stochastic Kriging". Note that the code depends on the GPML package.

"SK_uniform_MM1.m" is the main file to run the M/M/1 example. 

"SK_uniform_2D.m" is the main file to run the 2D example.

"nlogLikelihood.m", "infSK.m" and "gp_predict.m" are functions to make GPML compatible with the heteroscedastic case. 

"MM1_SimData.m" is the function to generate M/M/1 data.
